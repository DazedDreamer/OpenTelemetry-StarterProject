# Food System Service
## About
This system consists of three services: 
- The FoodFinder service allows a user to specify an ingredient they need, and consults with other services to try to find vendors with that for the user. 
- The FoodSupplier service acts as a database of FoodVendors, providing a candidate set of vendors who it believes may deal in the ingredient the user is looking for.
- The FoodVendor service offers certain ingredients at certain prices, and maintains an inventory of each.
